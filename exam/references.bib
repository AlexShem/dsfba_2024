  abstract     = {In many developed countries, population aging raises a number of issues related to the organization and financing of long-term care. While the determinants of the overall burden and cost of care are well understood, the organization of institutionalized long-term care must meet the needs of the elderly. One way to optimize management is to use information on health problems to assess the infrastructure needed, the qualifications of staff, and the allocation of new entrants. In this research, we determine the typical health profiles of institutionalized elderly using novel longitudinal data from nursing homes in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland. Our data contain comprehensive information on health factors such as impairments of psychological and sensory functions, levels of limitations, and pathologies for 21,549 individuals covering the period from 1996 to 2018. First, we perform a spectral clustering algorithm and determine the profiles of the institutionalized individuals. Then, we use multinomial logistic regression to study the effects of the factors that determine these health profiles. Our main findings include eight typical health profiles: the largest group consists of the most “healthy” individuals, who, on average, require the least amount of help with their daily needs and who stay in the institution the longest. We show that, in contrast to age at admission and gender, the limitations and the set of pathologies are relevant factors in determining the profile. Our study sheds light on the typical structures of elderly' health profiles, which can be used by institutions to organize their resources and by insurance companies to derive profile-based products that provide additional insurance coverage in case of special needs.}

  abstract     = {As many developed countries face the challenges of an aging population, the need to efficiently plan and finance long-term care (LTC) becomes increasingly important. Understanding the dynamics of care requirements and their associated costs is essential for sustainable healthcare systems. In this study, we employ a multi-state Markov model to analyze the transitions between care states of elderly individuals within institutional LTC in the canton of Geneva, Switzerland. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of 21,494 elderly residents, we grouped care levels into four broader categories reflecting the range from quasi-autonomy to severe dependency. Our model considers fixed covariates at admission, such as demographic details, medical diagnoses, and levels of dependence, to forecast transitions and associated costs. The main results illustrate significant variations in care trajectories and LTC costs across different health profiles, notably influenced by gender and initial care state. Females generally require longer periods with less intensive care, while conditions like severe and nervous diseases show quicker progression to more intensive care and higher initial costs. These transitions and expected length of stay in each state directly impact LTC costs, highlighting the necessity of advanced strategies to manage the financial burden. Our findings offer insights that can be utilized to optimize LTC services in response to the specific needs of institutionalized elderly people. These findings can be applied to enhance healthcare planning, the preparedness of infrastructure, and the design of insurance products.}
