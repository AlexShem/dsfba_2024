-   What does a data scientist do?
    -   *Jack of all trades.*
    -   Transform data into valuable information!
    -   A data scientist spends a significant portion of time processing data and less time modelling data.

## What is Data Science?

-   \bluebf{Wikipedia:} "the extraction of knowledge from data"
-   The precise definition is a bit unclear and controversial...
-   Practitioners "agree" on the components of data science:
    -   database management
    -   gathering and cleaning
    -   exploratory analysis
    -   predictive modelling
    -   data summary and visualization

# R

## S and R

-   S
    -   A statistical programming language
    -   First appeared in 1976
    -   Developed by John Chambers and (in earlier versions) Rick Becker and Allan Wilks of Bell Labs
    -   John Chambers, \emph{[the aim is] to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully}
-   R
    -   Modern implementation of S
    -   First appeared in 1993
    -   Created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland, New Zealand
    -   Currently developed by the \emph{R Development Core Team}

## Some "technical" details about R

-   Technical features:
    -   \bluebf{Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux} <!-- LOL -->
    -   Source code written primarily in C, Fortran, and R
    -   Multi-paradigm: object-oriented, functional, procedural
    -   Dynamically typed
    -   Scripting language (interpreted)
    -   \bluebf{Wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques} <!-- LOL -->
    -   \bluebf{Easily extensible through functions and packages} <!-- LOL -->
    -   \bluebf{Read/write from/to various data sources} <!-- LOL -->

## Base R

-   What is `Base R`?

\vspace{0.2cm}

> "The package named 'base' is in a way the core of R and contains the basic functions of the language, particularly, for reading and manipulating data."
>
> `r tufte::quote_footer('--- R for Beginners, Emmanuel Paradis')`

-   `Base R` includes all default code for performing common data manipulation and statistical tasks.
-   You might recognize some `Base R` functions:
    -   `mean()`, `median()`, `lm()`, `summary()`, `sort()`
    -   `data.frame()`, `read.csv()`, `cbind()`, `grep()`, `regexpr()`
    -   Many many more...
-   If you don't recognize any `Base R` functions, don't worry!

## The tidyverse

-   Common criticisms of `Base R`:
    -   The code doesn't flow as well as other languages.
    -   Function names/arguments are often inconsistent/confusing.
    -   `Base R` functions sometimes don't return type-stable objects.
    -   `Base R` functions are not refined to run as fast as possible.
    -   Other complaints exist...
-   So what is the [\bluebf{tidyverse}](https://www.tidyverse.org/)? A collection of R packages
    -   designed for data science,
    -   sharing an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.
-   Often, it performs the same tasks as `Base R`, but:
    -   Relies on a **pipe** operator to help with the flow of the code.
    -   More descriptive function names and consistent inputs.
    -   Type-stable.
    -   Often faster than common `Base R` functions.

## Core `tidyverse` packages

-   `ggplot2`: declarative graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics.
-   `dplyr`: grammar of data manipulation.
-   `tidyr`: functions that help you get to tidy data.
-   `readr`: reading in rectangular data.
-   `purrr`: enhancing R's functional programming (FP).
-   `tibble`: a modern `data.frame`.
-   `stringr`: makes working with strings as easy as possible.
-   `forcats`: useful tools for working with factors.

See more on the [tidyverse website](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/).

## `Base R` vs `tidyverse`

-   Why ever use `Base R`?
    -   Gets the job done!
    -   To become an expert, you have to know `Base R`.
    -   Some `Base R` functions are very common/useful, e.g., `mean()`.
-   What should you learn first? `Base R` or `tidyverse`?
    -   Some believe you should learn `Base R` first, others the `tidyverse` first.
    -   Lately, more are shifting to `tidyverse`...
