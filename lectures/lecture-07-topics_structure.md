# Introduction to Tidy Evaluation in `dplyr`

## What is Tidy Evaluation?
- **Tidy Evaluation** is a form of non-standard evaluation used in the `tidyverse`.
- It allows simpler expressions for data manipulation, making code more concise and readable.
- Two main concepts: **Data Masking** and **Tidy Selection**.

---

## Why Use Tidy Evaluation?
- Reduces the need for `df$column` syntax; instead, use `column` directly.
- Enables smooth data exploration and efficient manipulation, especially in interactive analysis.
- Supports consistent and flexible workflows across multiple `dplyr` functions.

---

## Practical Example: Tidy Evaluation
```r
# Filtering without Tidy Evaluation
starwars[starwars$homeworld == "Naboo" & starwars$species == "Human", ]

# Filtering with Tidy Evaluation
starwars %>% filter(homeworld == "Naboo", species == "Human")
```

---

# Data Masking in `dplyr`

## Overview of Data Masking
- **Data Masking** allows using data frame columns as if they were variables in the environment.
- Avoids repetitive references to the data frame.
- Key for efficient filtering, summarizing, and mutating.

---

## Data Masking in Action
- Distinguishes between **env-variables** (programming variables) and **data-variables** (statistical variables).
- Env-variables are created with `<-`, while data-variables are within the data frame.

---

## Practical Example: Data Masking
```r
# Using env-variable and data-variables
df <- data.frame(x = runif(3), y = runif(3))
df %>% mutate(z = x + y)
```

```r
# Filtering with Data Masking
starwars %>% filter(homeworld == "Naboo" & species == "Human")
```

---

# Tidy Selection for Column Operations

## What is Tidy Selection?
- **Tidy Selection** is a set of tools to easily select columns by name, type, or position.
- Allows for selecting columns dynamically within functions like `select()`, `mutate()`, `across()`.

---

## Tidy Selection Syntax
- Examples: `starts_with("x")`, `ends_with("z")`, `where(is.numeric)`.
- Can specify columns using multiple criteria within a single function.

---

## Practical Example: Tidy Selection
```r
# Selecting columns by pattern
mtcars %>% select(starts_with("c"))

# Selecting all numeric columns
mtcars %>% select(where(is.numeric))
```

---

# Programming with `dplyr`: Indirection Techniques

## What is Indirection in `dplyr`?
- **Indirection** refers to using variables dynamically within `dplyr` functions.
- Useful in functions and loops, especially when column names are stored as strings or variables.

---

## Techniques for Indirection
- Use `{{ }}` to embrace expressions within function arguments.
- `.data[[ ]]` helps when column names are in character vectors.

---

## Practical Example: Indirection with Embracing
```r
# Embracing with {{ }}
var_summary <- function(data, var) {
  data %>% summarise(n = n(), min = min({{ var }}), max = max({{ var }}))
}
mtcars %>% group_by(cyl) %>% var_summary(mpg)
```

```r
# Using .data with character vectors
vars <- c("mpg", "vs")
mtcars %>% summarise(across(all_of(vars), mean))
```

---

# Building Custom Summarization Functions

## Writing Flexible Summarization Functions
- Functions can accept variable column expressions to compute summaries dynamically.
- `across()` is key for creating flexible summaries over multiple columns.

---

## Custom Summarization Syntax
- Use `across()` inside `summarise()` to calculate statistics on chosen columns.
- Control output column names using `.names` within `across()`.

---

## Practical Example: Custom Summarization
```r
# Function to calculate means of selected columns
summarise_mean <- function(data, vars) {
  data %>% summarise(n = n(), across({{ vars }}, mean))
}
mtcars %>% group_by(cyl) %>% summarise_mean(where(is.numeric))
```

---

# Name Injection in Variable Names

## Dynamic Name Creation with Name Injection
- `:=` allows creating dynamic names for variables in a pipeline.
- Useful when column names are generated programmatically or from environment variables.

---

## Practical Example: Name Injection
```r
# Dynamic name assignment
name <- "dynamic_var"
tibble("{name}" := 2)

# Using dynamic name within a function
my_df <- function(x) {
  tibble("{{ x }}_2" := x * 2)
}
my_var <- 10
my_df(my_var)
```

# Creating and Using Nested Data Frames

## Introduction to Nested Data Frames
- **Nested Data Frames** are data frames with columns that are lists of data frames.
- Useful for working with grouped data and multiple models or transformations.

---

## Practical Example: Nesting and Unnesting
```r
# Creating nested data by group
df <- tibble(g = c(1, 2, 3), x = 1:3, y = 3:1)
nested_df <- df %>% group_by(g) %>% nest()

# Unnesting data
nested_df %>% unnest(data)
```

# Creating and Using Nested Data Frames

## What is a Nested Data Frame?
- A **Nested Data Frame** contains one or more columns as lists of data frames.
- Useful for organizing grouped data or subsetting for complex transformations and modeling.

---

## Creating Nested Data Frames
- Use `tidyr::nest()` to group columns into list-columns.
- Each list entry represents a data subset, allowing efficient grouping and nested operations.

```r
# Creating a nested data frame by grouping
df <- tribble(
  ~g, ~x, ~y,
   1,  1,  2,
   2,  4,  6,
   2,  5,  7,
   3, 10,  NA
)
df %>% nest(data = c(x, y))
```

---

## Practical Example: Nesting and Unnesting
```r
# Nesting by group
df_nested <- df %>% group_by(g) %>% nest()

# Unnesting to return original structure
df_nested %>% unnest(data)
```

---

# Nested Data and Modeling

## Using Nested Data for Modeling
- Nested data is ideal for fitting models across groups.
- Each subset in a list-column can hold an individual model or analysis result.

---

## Practical Example: Nesting `mtcars` for Modeling
- Group `mtcars` by `cyl` (number of cylinders) and nest data within each group.
```r
# Nesting mtcars data by cylinder
mtcars_nested <- mtcars %>% group_by(cyl) %>% nest()
```

---

## Building Models on Nested Data
- Use `purrr::map()` to fit models within each nested group.
- Store each model in a new list-column.

```r
# Fit models to each subset
mtcars_nested <- mtcars_nested %>% 
  mutate(model = map(data, ~ lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .x)))
```

---

## Extracting Predictions from Nested Models
- Generate predictions for each model using `map()` to apply `predict()`.
- Efficient way to produce predictions for each group in a single step.

```r
# Generate predictions
mtcars_nested <- mtcars_nested %>%
  mutate(predictions = map(model, predict))
```

---

# Summarizing Model Results with `broom`

## Using `broom` to Tidy Model Outputs
- `broom` provides functions like `tidy()`, `augment()`, and `glance()` to convert model outputs to data frames.
- This allows for consistent analysis and visualization of multiple models' outputs.

---

## Practical Example: Tidying with `broom::tidy()`
```r
# Tidying model results
library(broom)
mtcars_nested <- mtcars_nested %>%
  mutate(tidy_results = map(model, tidy))

# Unnesting to view all results in a flat format
mtcars_nested %>% unnest(tidy_results)
```

---

## Advanced Tidying: `augment()` and `glance()`
- **`augment()`**: Adds model predictions and residuals to the original data.
- **`glance()`**: Summarizes model fit statistics.

```r
# Adding model summaries
mtcars_nested <- mtcars_nested %>%
  mutate(augmented = map(model, augment),
         glance_results = map(model, glance))
```

---

# Combining and Visualizing Model Summaries

## Workflow: Nest, Map, and Unnest
- Combine nested data manipulation and `broom` outputs for a complete summary.
- Use `unnest()` to organize results into a single, interpretable data frame.

```r
# Complete workflow with tidying and unnesting
mtcars_nested %>%
  unnest(c(tidy_results, augmented, glance_results))
```

---

## Practical Application: Model Comparison
- Easily compare models across groups with tidied outputs.
- Sort or filter by fit statistics, visualize parameter estimates, or compare residuals.

```r
# Example: Sorting by R-squared from glance results
mtcars_nested %>%
  unnest(glance_results) %>%
  arrange(desc(r.squared))
```
