### 4. ðŸ“‹ **Final Report**

#### ðŸ“… **Due Date:** December 23

#### ðŸ“„ **Submission Details**

- **Submission Type:** File upload via Moodle.
- **Files to Submit:** 
  - Quarto file (`.qmd`) and the compiled HTML file generated from it.
- **File Naming Convention:** Name your files as `final_<group_name>.qmd` and `final_<group_name>.html`, where `<group_name>` corresponds to your assigned group (e.g., `final_A.qmd`, `final_A.html`).

#### ðŸ“‹ **Report Requirements**

- The **compiled HTML file** should be a standalone document containing all the code, which by default should be **hidden**. This ensures the document is clean and readable, focusing on your analysis and findings while still providing access to the underlying code for reproducibility.
- The Quarto and HTML files should detail your entire project workflow, including data collection, analysis, statistical methods used, and insights gained. Document your process, including any alternative solutions you explored.

#### ðŸ“‘ **Report Structure**

Your report should cover the following key sections. The depth of discussion in each section may vary depending on your project:

- **Overview and Motivation:** Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation behind your study. Write this section assuming the reader did not see your proposal.
- **Related Work:** Mention any relevant papers, websites, or discussions that inspired or guided your work.
- **Research Questions:** Outline the questions you aimed to answer and how they evolved during the project. Highlight any new questions that arose during your analysis.
- **Data:** Describe your data sources, methods of data collection, data cleaning, and preprocessing steps.
- **Exploratory Analysis:** Present visualisations and justify your decisions. Discuss any major changes to your ideas based on this analysis.
- **Modelling (Optional):** Explain the statistical methods or models considered, reasons for your choices, and any competing approaches evaluated.
- **Answering the Research Questions and Final Analysis:** Summarise what you learned from the data, how you answered your research questions, and provide justification for your conclusions.

#### ðŸ“‚ **Optional Data Submission**

- While it is not mandatory, you are encouraged to provide your data if it is accessible and non-sensitive. Sharing your data can help the Professor and Captains better understand your work and provide more targeted feedback.
- If submitting data is not feasible, ensure your report includes clear documentation of your data access and preparation steps, including sources and any preprocessing conducted.

#### ðŸ“Š **Grading Criteria**

Your final report will be evaluated based on the following scale:

- **Overview, Motivation, Related Work, Research Questions:** 10/100
- **Data Sources and Description:** 10/100
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** 35/100
- **Answering Research Questions and Final Analysis:** 35/100
- **Aesthetics, English Writing, Project Organization, Code Quality:** 10/100
- **Bonus Points (up to 20/100):** Awarded for innovative use of interactive visualisations or presenting your work in an exceptional format, such as a complementary website.

#### ðŸ“‚ **Code Expectations**

- Your Quarto file should contain high-quality and readable R code that emphasises reproducibility, efficiency, and clear data cleaning processes.
- Document your code thoroughly to enhance readability and facilitate understanding of your workflow.
