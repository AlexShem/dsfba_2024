- **Modelling (Optional):** Explain the statistical methods or models considered, reasons for your choices, and any competing approaches evaluated.
- **Answering the Research Questions and Final Analysis:** Summarise what you learned from the data, how you answered your research questions, and provide justification for your conclusions.

#### 📂 **Optional Data Submission**

- While it is not mandatory, you are encouraged to provide your data if it is accessible and non-sensitive. Sharing your data can help the Professor and Captains better understand your work and provide more targeted feedback.
- If submitting data is not feasible, ensure your report includes clear documentation of your data access and preparation steps, including sources and any preprocessing conducted.

#### 📊 **Grading Criteria**

Your final report will be evaluated based on the following scale:

- **Overview, Motivation, Related Work, Research Questions:** 10/100
