## üìë Detailed Milestone Descriptions

### 1. üìù **Project Proposal**

#### üìÖ **Due Date:** October 14

#### üìÑ **Submission Details**

- **Submission Type:** File upload via Moodle.
- **File Format:** Quarto file (`.qmd`).
- **File Naming Convention:** Name your file as `proposal_<group_name>.qmd` where `<group_name>` corresponds to your assigned group (e.g., `proposal_A.qmd`, `proposal_B.qmd`, ..., `proposal_AQ.qmd`).

#### üìã **Requirements**

- The **title** of your project can be changed at a later date, so don't worry if you're not set on a final title yet.
- Each team (or individual if working alone) only needs to submit **one proposal**.
- We reserve the right to reject a project proposal if it is not judged satisfactory, but our main goal is to set you on a path to success!

#### üìÇ **Template for Submission**

- A template will be provided to guide you in preparing your proposal. Please use the [provided template](#) and follow the structure below when preparing your submission:
  - **Background and Motivation:** Explain why you chose this topic and why it is important.
  - **Project Objectives:** Clearly state what you aim to achieve.
  - **Research Questions:** Outline the key questions your project will address.
  - **Data Source:** Identify the data you plan to use and how you will acquire it.
  - **Data Description:** Describe the key features of your data.
  - **Schedule & Timeline:** Provide a brief timeline for your project, highlighting key milestones.

#### üîó **Submission Link**

- Upload your Quarto file on Moodle using [this link](#).

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**

- Ensure your file is well-organized and follows the provided template.
- Submissions must be in the correct format and filename to be accepted.

Good luck with your project proposal! üöÄ

### 2. üìà **Project Update**

- Make sure that the title is final at this point.
- Use [the suggested template](https://moodle.unil.ch/mod/resource/view.php?id=1804840).
- Each team (or individual if working alone) only needs to submit one update (HTML file only).
- The update should cover more or less half of the final report's content, but we don't expect the figures/summary tables to be finalized/polished.

### 3. üé• **Video Presentation**

Please use [this link](https://moodle.unil.ch/mod/assign/view.php?id=1804836) to upload a **seven minutes video presentation** showing a demo of your project and/or some slides:

- Only one per group is needed.
- If you choose to upload the video file itself, there's a **50MB size limit**.
- If you choose to upload a link  (e.g., Youtube, Google Drive, Dailymotion or equivalent), make sure it is **publicly accessible**.

We will **strictly enforce the time limit**, so please make sure you are not running longer. 
Use principles of good storytelling and presentations to get your key points across.
Focus the majority of your presentation on your main contributions rather than on technical details. 
What do you feel is the best part of your project? 
What insights did you gain? 
What is the single most important thing you would like your audience to take away? 
Make sure it is upfront and center rather than at the end.

We use the following [criteria to evaluate oral presentations](https://dept.writing.wisc.edu/wac/the-challenge-of-evaluating-oral-presentations/):

- Content (4/20)
- Organization (4/20)
- Teamwork (4/20, project done individually automatically earn the 4 points)
- Visuals (4/20)
- Presentation mechanics (4/20)

A **50MB or less** file or a  (e.g., Youtube, Dailymotion or equivalent) link to a **publicly accessible** video should be submitted on **15/12**, and slides should be submitted by the same day.

### 4. üìã **Final Report**

The final report is composed of two parts:

- Quarto and compiled HTML files describe the project in details.
- The slides from your presentation.

#### Quarto and Compiled HTML

Please use this [link](https://moodle.unil.ch/mod/assign/view.php?id=1804837) to submit your final report!

The most important deliverable of your project is the set of Quarto and compiled HTML files by **12/22**. 
They should detail your steps in developing your solution, including how you collected the data, alternative solutions you tried, describing statistical methods you used, and the insights you got. 
Equally important to your final results is how you got there! 
Your Quarto and HTML files are the place you describe and document the space of possibilities you explored at each step of your project. 
We strongly advise you to include many visualizations.

Your Quarto should include the following topics. 
Depending on your project type, the amount of discussion you devote to each of them will vary:

- **Overview and Motivation**: Provide an overview of the project goals and the motivation for it. Consider that this will be read by people who did not see your project proposal.
- **Related Work**: Anything that inspired you, such as a paper, a website, or something we discussed in class.
- **Research Questions**: What questions are you trying to answer? How did these questions evolve over the course of the project? What new questions did you consider in the course of your analysis?
- **Data**: Source, scraping method, cleanup, etc.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: What visualizations did you use to look at your data in different ways? Justify the decisions you made, and show any major changes to your ideas. How did you reach these conclusions?
- **Modeling (optional)**: What are the different statistical methods you considered? Why did you choose a given model?  How about competing approaches?
- **Answering the Research Questions and Final Analysis**: What did you learn about the data? How did you answer the questions? How can you justify your answers?

As this will be your only chance to describe your project in detail, make sure that your Quarto file and compiled HTML file are standalone documents that fully describe your process and results. 
For instructions on how to submit, please see **Submission Instructions** below.

As a side note, the following scale will be used to grade projects:

- Overview, motivation, related work, research questions: 10/100
- Data sources and description: 10/100
- Exploratory data analysis: 35/100
- Answering the research questions and final analysis: 35/100
- Aesthetics, English writing, project organization, code quality: 10/100
- Additionally, you have the opportunity to earn bonuses of up to 20/100 (e.g., by using interactive visualization or presenting your work in especially interesting ways, for instance by complementing your report with a website generated with markdown).

#### Code

We expect you to write high-quality and readable R code in your Quarto file. 
You should strive for doing things the right way and think about aspects such as reproducibility, efficiency, cleaning data, etc. 
We also expect you to document your code.

## Grading

- The project proposal is worth 5% of the overall course grade.
- The project update is worth 5% of the overall course grade.
- The report and the presentation represent 70% of the overall course grade:
  - 50% for your Quarto files and the knitted report. This includes the quality of your data analysis and R code, the complexity and level of difficulty of your project, completeness and overall functionality of your analysis.
  - 20% for your presentation and the quality of its storytelling aspects.
