### üìã **Report Requirements**:

The final report is the most important deliverable of your project and should comprehensively document the entire data science process you followed. Your report should be detailed and well-organized, showcasing how you collected the data, processed it, analyzed it, and what insights you gained. 

**Key Sections to Include**:

1. **Overview and Motivation**:
   - Provide an overview of the project goals and your motivation for choosing the topic.
   - This should be written assuming the reader has not seen your proposal.

2. **Related Work**:
   - Reference any relevant papers, websites, or discussions that guided your project or served as inspiration.

3. **Research Questions**:
   - Clearly outline the research questions you set out to answer and how these evolved during your project.

4. **Data**:
   - Describe the data sources, how you collected or acquired the data, and any preprocessing steps.
   - Address data cleaning, transformations, and potential issues with the data.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Include well-thought-out visualizations and summaries of the data.
   - Justify the decisions behind the visualizations and the insights they provided.

6. **Modeling (Optional)**:
   - Discuss any models or statistical methods you used (if applicable).
   - Explain why you chose these models and interpret the results.

7. **Answering the Research Questions and Final Analysis**:
   - Provide your final analysis and explain how you answered the research questions.
   - Justify your conclusions based on the data and analysis.

8. **Aesthetics and Code**:
   - The HTML report should have a clean, professional look. 
   - By default, all code in the final report should be **hidden**, but the underlying code should still be available for review if needed. Ensure that your Quarto file is well-documented and that your code is readable and follows best practices.

### üìÇ **Optional Data Submission**:

While it is not mandatory, you are encouraged to provide your dataset if it is accessible and non-sensitive. Sharing your data can help the Professor and Captains better understand your analysis. If submitting data is not feasible, please ensure your report includes clear documentation of your data sources and how you prepared the data.
